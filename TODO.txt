Print newlines so result is in matrix format

Notes:
r = np.random.randint(-15, 16, (10000))
C code may have slight advantage in not having to reallocate memory
WebGPU memory overhead very large -- calculations themselves are fast
WASM code ran almost 3 times slower when the javascript console was open
C code was tested on a different computer that showed similar WASM runtimes
